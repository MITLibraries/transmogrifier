                        <p>The records of the Mid-Ocean Dynamics Experiment came to the Institute Archives in two accessions in 1980 and 1982. During processing the collection was reduced from fifteen cubic feet to four by discarding duplicate materials, financial records, and publications not authored by MODE participants. Forty charts and six inches of raw data presented the primary appraisal issues. The raw data consisted of bulletins and reports referring to float positions, moorings, isotherms, geostrophic velocity calculations, ships' summaries, and work proposed and work carried out during the MODE-I experiment. </p>

                        <p>Charles J. Connick (1875-1945) was an American stained glass artist whose work may be found in cities all across the United States. Connick's works in the Arts and Crafts movement and beyond uniquely combined ancient and modern techniques and also sparked a revival of medieval European stained glass craftsmanship. Connick studied symbols and the interaction between light, color and glass, as well as the crucial connection between the stained glass window and its surrounding architecture.</p>
                        <p>Connick founded his own studio in 1912 in Boston. </p>
