            "Heat is carried by different types quasiparticles in crystals, including "
            "phonons, charge carriers, and magnetic excitations. In most materials, "
            "thermal transport can be understood as the flow of phonons and charge "
            "carriers; magnetic heat flow is less well-studied and less well "
            "understood.\r \rRecently, the concept of the flat band, with a vanishing "
            "dispersion, has gained importance. Especially in electronic systems, many "
            "theories and experiments have proven that some structures such as kagome "
            "or honeycomb lattices hosts such flat bands with non-trivial topology. "
            "Even though a number of theories suggest that such dispersionless mode "
            "exist in magnonic bands under the framework of the Heisenberg spin model, "
            "few experiments indicate its existence. Not limited to these flat band "
            "effects, magnetic insulators can assume a variety of nontrivial "
            "topologies such as magnetic skyrmions. In this thesis, I investigate the "
            "highly frustrated magnetic system Y0.5Ca0.5BaCo4O7, where the kagome "
            "lattice could potentially lead to nontrivial thermal transport originated "
            "from its flat band. While we do not observe signatures of the flat band "
            "in thermal conductivity, the observed anomalous Hall effect in electrical "
            "transport and spin glass-like behavior suggest a complex "
            "magnetization-transport mechanism.\r\rMotivated by the rapid advancement "
            "of artificial inteligence, the application of machine learning into "
            "materials exploration is recently investigated. Using a graphical "
            "representation of crystallines orginally suggested in Crystal Graphical "
            "Convolutional Neural Network (CGCNN), we developed the ML-asssited method "
            "to explore magnetic compounds. Our machine learning model can, so far, "
            "distiguish ferromagnet or antiferromagnet systems with over 70% accuracy "
            "based only on structual/elemental information. Prospects of studying more "
            "complex magnets are described."
